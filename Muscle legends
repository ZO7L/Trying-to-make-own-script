Here's a basic script code for Muscle Legends:
```
-- Muscle Legends Script
-- Warning: Use responsibly and at your own risk

-- Load libraries
local library = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeHub/Scripts/main/Library.lua"))()

-- Auto-farm muscles
local function autoFarmMuscles()
    while true do
        -- Insert muscle training code here
        game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").TrainMuscle:FireServer()
        wait()
    end
end

-- Auto-clicker
local function autoClick()
    while true do
        -- Insert click code here
        game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Click:FireServer()
        wait()
    end
end

-- Enable auto-farm muscles
autoFarmMuscles()

-- Enable auto-clicker
autoClick()
```
This script uses basic auto-farm and auto-click functionality. You'll need to customize it to fit your specific needs.
